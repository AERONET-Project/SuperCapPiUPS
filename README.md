### Description

This PCB designed to be a hat for rasberry pi; interface on top of a pi. This is a Buck booster. It protects the Pi from crashing when it is unplugged without properly being shut down. There is a lot of open space because I was practicing keeping components as compact as possible. It also leaves a convenient place to put the 15F 5.4V Capacitor. 


### Progress

- [x] Created Symbols for Buck Converter
- [x] Created schematic
- [x] Created footprints for capacitors and Buck Converter and inductor
- [x] Created PCB layout
- [x] put silly images on PCB
- [x] removed silly images on PCB
- [x] Added signiture and USNA crest to PCB
- [x] uploaded to repo
- [ ] finished README
